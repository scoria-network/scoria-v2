## About
### What is Scoria?
Scoria is a semi-anonymous social network. You know who your friends are, but you don't know which friend makes which post.

### Use cases
1. Steve is lonely and wants to talk to someone, but he is a bad person and nobody likes him. He can use Scoria to make conversation with someone who otherwise wouldn't want to talk to him. Good for you, Steve.
2. George wants a place to gossip about how Janet's boyfriend cheated on her by kissing a French girl. He can use Scoria to remain anonymous and not jeopardize his friendship with Janet. Nice going, George.
3. Eileen doesn't get the attention from boys she feels she deserves. She can use Scoria to talk anonymously about how attractive she is in hopes that the boys take notice and agree. Come on, Eileen.
